## Circular Motion

This is a small POC using JS to animate a circle on the screen and following the user mouse location using some visual effects.

`src` contains the source - with canvas being the JS file that powers the Animation

`dist` contains the exported version for distribution

The remainder of the repository is node_modules required (that will be installed anyway following yarn) as well as webpack to do live prototyping.

## Pre-requisite

Locate the project folder

Clone the template repo to have a dev server tailored for rapid THREE.js development.

```
git clone https://github.com/christopher4lis/three-boilerplate.git
```
Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

To run locally use:

```
npm start
```
